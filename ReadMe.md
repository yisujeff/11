# Project5 Data Visulaization: Ford GoBike Data

## Overview

Using Python to explore Ford GoBike data in San Francisco on Feb 2019.

Since Lyft might try to connect bike rides to their car rides, My thought is how to implement the idea of integration of two different mobility service. So, I became curious on main user groups characteristics, the purpose of using the service, and popular routes. 


```python

```

## Summary

>1 Generally, around 90% of rides take place on weekday. Also, more than 70% of users are in 20 to 40 years old age(when mean age is 32).

>2 89% of rides are from subscribers and the rest 11% are from customers. Also, Average trip duration for subscribers are 12minutes, which is about a third of customers'.

>3 'Bike share for all' program is a subscription model for low income bay area residents. Unlike for all members where there were two peak time around both morning commute time and evening commute time, there is only one peak time for 'Bike share for all' members around 5pm.

>4 The paths of all bike rides show that most rides happened around SOMA(South of Market), such as Embarcadero street, market street and townsend street.
